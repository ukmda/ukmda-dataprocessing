        <p><b>Privacy and Data Protection Policy</b></p>
        <p><em>Last reviewed 2023-08-15</em></p>
        <p>This page explains how we handle any personal and sensitive data that we collect. </p>
        <hr>
        <b>Camera ID, name and geographic location of each camera.</b>
        <p>
            We collect the Camera ID, general location name and precise geographic coordinates
            of each camera for the following purposes:

            <li>For Scientific data analysis such as statistical reporting of showers, orbit and trajectory
                calculations of meteors detected by the camera. The results of this analysis are made available
                on this website.
            </li>
            <li>
                To exchange data with researchers, other dection networks and the interested public
                as part of our commitment to an open data policy, and in particular to help identify
                the location of any possible meteorite falls. The downloadable data are made available
                on this website.
            </li>
            <li>
                Camera ID and general location may also be used in publications and papers, where relevant
                and pertinent to the subject matter of the paper.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, we might collect Camera ID UK1234, location name Sunthorp*, geographic coordinates
            53.62501N 0.08567E, altitude -20m. If a paper is published which makes use of data from this
            camera, the author might mention the camera ID and approximate location in the paper.

            We collect your name and email address for the purpose of communication with you in relation to:

        <b>Postal Address</b>
        <p>
            If you have asked us to build a camera for you, the camera builder will also ask for
            your full Postal Address so that the items can be posted. We do not retain this information
            anywhere on our systems.

        <b>Publications</b>
        <p>
            Where data or images from your camera are used in a publication, it is standard practice
            for you to be credited. Your name may therefore appear alongside any images, in the text
            of a publication or in a list of credits. If you do not wish to be credited with your
            data, please let us know.

        <b>Scientific Data</b>
        <p>
            The Cameras we collect data from are part of the Global Meteor Network and use the RMS software.
            The RMS software produces several levels of data products:
            <li>Level 1 - The lowest level data (i.e. as close to "raw" as possible) are the FF image 
                and FR video files saved by the capture code and the fireball detector.</li>
            <li>Level 2 - The meteor detector uses the Level 1 data to extract positional and brightness information
                 of individual meteors (FTPdetectinfo file), and images are also used for astrometric 
                 and photometric calibration (platepar file). Meteor and star detections are used to 
                 generate a range of plots suchs as the single-station shower association graph, camera 
                 drift graph, etc. The calibrated meteors measurements get uploaded to the archive  
                 together with the raw images of individual meteors.</li>
            <li>Level 3 - The software that we run correlates individual observations and 
                computes multi-station meteor trajectories which are published daily on this website. 
                These data are made public under the CC BY 4.0 license as required by the authors of the RMS software.</li>
                <br>
            The following points should be noted in relation to these data: 
            <ol>
            <li>Operators of individual stations exclusively own the 
            Level 1 and Level 2 data their stations produce. In practice, this means that they are free to share 
            this data with other meteor networks if they wish to do so. 
            </li>
            <li>By agreeing to contribute, you are agreeing that Level 1 and Level 2 data may be used 
            by the network coordinators to manually produce other products such as Level 3 data, and that
            publication of such results may include any Level 2 data that was used, where this is necessary to explain
            or validate the Level 3 data. <br> For example, when Level 2 
            data is combined to calculate an orbit or trajectory (Level 3 data), then the relevant Level 2 data may be made 
            available to other researchers so that they may verify or improve our calculations. </li>
            <li>These data will be retained indefinitely even if you cease to contribute.</li>
            </ol>

            * Sunthorp is a lost village in the Humber Estuary. It was recorded in the Domesday Book
            but was washed away in about 1350 according to an account in the Chronicles of Meaux. 
            It does not host a camera!
